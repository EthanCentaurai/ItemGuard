ItemGuard
=========

User-configurable protection for your inventory. Automatically buys back mistakenly sold items.

What it does
------------

This addon will automatically buy back any items that you have told the addon to protect.
Simply type in "/itemguard" into the chatbox, shift-click the item you wish to protect, and then press enter.

It should look like this:
```
/itemguard [Fishing Pole]
```

To remove protection from an item, simply repeat the above.

If you do accidentally sell a protected item to a vendor, ItemGuard will buy it back and will notify you that it has done so.

You *WILL NOT* lose any money as a result, nor do you have to incur a 30-day cooldown on Blizzard's item restoration service in order to get the item back!

Translations
------------

ItemGuard will work for everyone regardless of language, but its notification text is currently only in English.
